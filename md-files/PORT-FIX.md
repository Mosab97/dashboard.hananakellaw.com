# Port 80 Conflict - Fixed ✅

## Issue
Port 80 was already in use on your machine (probably Apache or another web server).

## Solution Applied
Changed nginx to use **port 8000** instead of port 80.

---

## 🚀 Run This Now:

```bash
# Restart with the new port configuration
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## 🌐 Access Your Application

- **Your Laravel App**: http://localhost:8000 (changed from port 80)
- **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8080 (unchanged)

---

## ✅ What Changed

- Nginx now listens on port **8000** instead of 80
- All documentation updated
- APP_URL updated to `http://localhost:8000`

---

## Alternative: Find What's Using Port 80

If you want to free up port 80 and use it instead:

```bash
# On macOS, find what's using port 80:
sudo lsof -i :80

# Common culprits:
# - Apache (stop with: sudo apachectl stop)
# - Nginx (stop with: sudo nginx -s stop)
# - Other Docker containers
```

Then you can change the port back to 80 in `docker-compose.yml` if you prefer.

**Just run `docker-compose up -d` and visit http://localhost:8000! 🎉**
