# Docker Setup - Issue Fixed âœ…

## Problem
The Docker build was failing because your `composer.lock` file contains packages that require PHP 8.3, but the Dockerfile was using PHP 8.2.

### Error Details
```
maennchen/zipstream-php 3.2.0 requires php-64bit ^8.3
-> your php-64bit version (8.2.29) does not satisfy that requirement.
```

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made:
1. âœ… **Upgraded PHP version** from 8.2 to 8.3 in Dockerfile
2. âœ… **Moved composer install** to runtime (after container starts) to avoid build-time issues
3. âœ… **Removed obsolete `version`** attribute from docker-compose.yml
4. âœ… **Updated documentation** to reflect PHP 8.3

## How to Run Now

### Step 1: Clean up old containers (if any)
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose rm -f
```

### Step 2: Remove old images
```bash
docker rmi laravel-app 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 3: Run the setup script
```bash
./docker-setup.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
- Build new containers with PHP 8.3
- Start all services
- Install composer dependencies (with correct PHP version)
- Run migrations
- Set permissions
- Everything will be ready!

## Alternative: Manual Steps

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# 1. Build and start containers
docker-compose up -d --build

# 2. Install composer dependencies
docker-compose exec app composer install --optimize-autoloader

# 3. Generate app key
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate

# 4. Run migrations
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate

# 5. Set permissions
docker-compose exec app chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

## Access Your Application

After setup completes:
- **Application**: http://localhost
- **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8080
  - Username: laravel
  - Password: secret

## Services Running

| Service | Container | Port |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Laravel App | laravel-app | - |
| Nginx | laravel-nginx | 80 |
| MySQL | laravel-mysql | 3306 |
| phpMyAdmin | laravel-phpmyadmin | 8080 |

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Access shell
docker-compose exec app bash

# Run artisan commands
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate

# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# Restart
docker-compose restart
```

## What Was Fixed

âœ… PHP version compatibility  
âœ… Composer dependencies installation  
âœ… Docker Compose warnings  
âœ… Build process optimization  
âœ… Documentation updates
